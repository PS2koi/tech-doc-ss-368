      <header>Introduction</header>
      <p>Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV) is a critically acclaimed MMORPG developed and published by Square Enix, set in the vast and immersive world of Eorzea.</p>

      <p>Originally released in 2010 and later relaunched as A Realm Reborn in 2013, the game features a deep and evolving story, engaging combat, and a rich variety of activities, including crafting, gathering, housing, and player-versus-player (PvP) modes. Players create a customizable character and choose from multiple classes and jobs, seamlessly switching between them as they progress.</p>

      <p>The game offers a mix of solo and multiplayer experiences, with AI companions available for dungeons and large-scale content like raids and trials designed for cooperative play. With multiple expansions, such as Heavensward, Stormblood, Shadowbringers, and Endwalker, FFXIV continues to grow, delivering new challenges, stories, and social experiences that keep players engaged.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="ways_of_installing">
      <header>Ways of installing</header>
      <p>You can install FFXIV on:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Your PC with the official launcher (highly recommended over Steam) or Steam.</li>
        <li>Playstation 4/5</li>
        <li>Xbox Series X|S</li>
      </ol>
      <p>However, once you choose a platform you cannot play on the same account if you want to play on a different platform, this includes Steam and SE’s official launcher, you must choose one. There is no account cross-save and no cross-buying expansions so choose wisely.</p>
      <p>Need an example? Let’s say I want to play FFXIV through Square Enix’s official launcher on PC, I make a Square Enix Account. For the entirety of playing FFXIV, I will have to play on PC and buy the Starter Edition and the latest expansion pack through the Square Enix store. If I wanted to play through Steam I will buy the expansions and starter edition off of steam. Same goes for console, I will buy expansions off of the Playstation Store or the Xbox Store. However though once you start paying for subscription to play the game, you will go to the Mogstation online to pay your subscription fees.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="free_vs_subscription">
      <header>Free VS Subscription</header>
      <p>The Free Trial and Subscription work very differently from each other.</p>
      <p>As a free trial player, you will not have access to certain things.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No Trading, Market Board, or Retainers.</li>
        <li>No Joining or Creating Free Companies. (Guilds)</li>
        <li>No Sending or Receiving Mail or Gil.</li>
        <li>No Buying Houses or Apartments.</li>
        <li>No Paid Services (Fantasia, World Transfers, Optional Items, etc.)</li>
        <li>No Access to expansions later than Stormblood.</li>
        <li>No Leveling Past 70 (Or earning exp beyond it.)</li>
        <li>Max Gil/Money Cap: 300,000</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you like the game and decide you want to start putting in the money to play the game, get the required starter edition, you will get a free month of playtime and your progress in the free trial will be saved and the restrictions on your account will be lifted. If you want to get access to all expansions as well buy the latest expansion pack as it contains all of the not included expansions that are not in the starter edition. You do not have to buy every expansion that is not in the starter edition. You only have to get the latest expansion to get access to all expansions.</p>
      <p>Once you do get the starter edition you will be required to pay money to play the game after your free month is gone. Usually what people will say it costs $15 a month, there is another cheaper option, but you will only be allowed to make 8 characters, one on each world of a datacenter. This option costs $13 a month rather than $15 which saves money.
      </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="starting_the_game">
      <header>Starting The Game</header>
      <p>Booting up the game through whichever platform you are using, press the start button on the main screen. There’s also a button for movies/videos, I recommend avoiding watching the current trailer for the latest expansion as it will include spoilers for the main story before that current expansion. Other than that though once you press the start button, you will be able to make your character. You have many options to choose from excluding some expansion races when in free trial.

      </ol>
      There are a few of things to keep in mind:
      <ol>
        <li>You can change your race and name after making your character, though you will have to do that through optional store/mogstation by getting a Fantasia or requesting a name change, these both cost money. However if you want to just change your race and don’t want to pay money, you will get a completely free fantasia after completing A Realm Reborn (base game).
        <li>If you want to only change some small things about your character like your hair, the game has a side quest that allows you to do just that. The shown hairstyles in the character creator are not the only hairstyles available, you can unlock more by playing the game and or buying exclusive hairstyles of the optional store.
        <li>Birthday of your character and chosen god do not affect stats/gameplay. They are there for roleplaying purposes.
      </ol>

    <section class="main-section" id="starting_job/class">
      <header>Starting Job/Class</header>
      <p>You will be prompted to choose your starting class and have choice of choosing classes that categorize as Disciples of War and Disciples of Magic. (Depending on your chosen class you will start in one of the major 3 starting cities.)</p>

      <p>Gladiator/Paladin (PLD)</p>
      <p>
        Paladins are holy knights who balance offense and defense with precision. Wielding a sword and shield, they can protect allies with powerful defensive abilities while striking foes with divine magic and swift swordplay. Their invulnerable stance, Hallowed Ground, makes them nearly unstoppable for a short duration, allowing them to withstand deadly attacks. They also have healing spells to sustain themselves in battle, making them one of the most durable and supportive tanks.</p>

      <div class="job">
        <code>class Paladin {
          int health = 100;

          void blockAttack() {
          System.out.println("Paladin blocks the attack, reducing damage taken!");
          }
          }</code>
      </div>

      <p>Marauder/Warrior (WAR)</p>
      <p>
        Warriors are ferocious berserkers who channel their inner rage to fuel devastating axe attacks. Their playstyle revolves around absorbing damage, healing through attacks, and dishing out massive bursts of damage. With their iconic ability, Inner Release, they unleash unrelenting combos while shrugging off blows with raw strength and self-healing skills. Warriors are great for players who love a brutal, aggressive tanking style while still being incredibly self-sufficient.</p>

      <div class="job">
        <code>class Warrior {
          boolean isBerserk = false;

          void enterBerserkMode() {
          isBerserk = true;
          System.out.println("Warrior enters Berserk Mode!");
          }
          }</code>
      </div>

      <p>Pugilist/Monk (MNK)</p>
      Monks are masters of martial arts, using their fists and feet to deliver rapid, combo-based attacks. Their playstyle revolves around positioning, as many of their strongest abilities require striking enemies from specific angles. By building chakra and unleashing devastating techniques like Perfect Balance, Monks offer a high-speed, high-damage playstyle. They are great for players who love fast-paced combat with a focus on movement and execution.</p>

      <div class="job">
        <code>class Monk {
          void executeCombo() {
          System.out.println("Monk performs a powerful three-hit combo!");
          }
          }</code>
      </div>

      <p>Lancer/Dragoon (DRG)</p>
      <p>Dragoons are lance-wielding warriors who leap into battle with graceful, acrobatic attacks. Their playstyle focuses on jumping abilities that deal massive damage while maintaining a rhythm of powerful combos. With their high burst potential and flashy moves like Dragonfire Dive, Dragoons are a favorite among players who enjoy precision-based melee combat with a stylish flair.</p>

      <div class="job">
        <code>class Dragoon {
          void jumpAttack() {
          System.out.println("Dragoon leaps into the air and lands a crushing attack!");
          }
          }</code>
      </div>

      <p>Archer/Bard (BRD)</p>
      <p>Bards are musical archers who mix damage-dealing with party-wide buffs. Their playstyle revolves around using different songs to empower their allies while firing a flurry of arrows at their enemies. While they lack the highest personal damage, their ability to enhance the entire party’s strength makes them an essential support DPS. Players who enjoy a fast-paced, versatile combat style with a buffing role will love playing Bard.</p>

      <div class="job">
        <code>class Bard {
          void playSong(String songName) {
          System.out.println("Bard plays " + songName + ", boosting allies' morale!");
          }
          }</code>
      </div>

      <p>Thaumaturge/Black Mage (BLM)</p>
      <p>Black Mages are the masters of destructive magic, using Fire, Ice, and Thunder spells to annihilate enemies. Their playstyle revolves around high-damage spellcasting with little mobility, requiring careful positioning to maximize their output. However, when mastered, Black Mages boast some of the highest damage in the game. Players who enjoy a traditional spellcasting role with a focus on planning and big damage numbers will love Black Mage.</p>

      <div class="job">
        <code>class BlackMage {
          void castFire() {
          System.out.println("Black Mage casts Fire! Flames engulf the enemy.");
          }
          }</code>
      </div>

      <p>Arcanist/Summoner (SMN)</p>
      <p>Summoners command magical beings, summoning mighty creatures like Ifrit, Titan, and Garuda to fight alongside them. They also use damage-over-time (DoT) spells to weaken foes while their summons execute powerful attacks. Their flexible playstyle allows them to switch between strong area damage and single-target nukes, making them a great choice for players who love pet-based combat and flashy magic.</p>

      <div class="job">
        <code>class Summoner {
          void summonIfrit() {
          System.out.println("Summoner calls Ifrit to unleash fiery devastation!");
          }
          }</code>
      </div>

      <p>Conjurer/White Mage (WHM)</p>
      <p>
        White Mages are the purest form of healers, wielding powerful restoration magic to keep their party alive. Their spells include massive area-of-effect heals, regen effects, and powerful bursts of recovery. They also have access to strong offensive spells like Holy, allowing them to contribute to damage when healing isn’t needed. White Mage is great for players who enjoy a straightforward, high-impact healing role with strong emergency recovery.</p>

      <div class="job">
        <code>class WhiteMage {
          void heal() {
          System.out.println("White Mage casts afflatus solace!");
          }
          }</code>
      </div>
      <p>Arcanist/Scholar (SCH)</p>
      <p>
        Scholars are tactical healers who fight alongside fairy companions that automatically assist with healing. They specialize in damage mitigation and shielding, ensuring that the party takes less damage in the first place. Their unique playstyle requires planning ahead, making them perfect for those who enjoy a more strategic, proactive healing role.</p>
      <div class="job">
        <code>class Scholar {
          void summonFairy() {
          System.out.println("Scholar summons a fairy to assist in healing!");
          }
          }</code>
      </div>

      <p>It is important to know that you are not locked to just one class after picking, you can grab any of these classes including some others offered in the free trial and switch between them given you meet the level requirement level 10 to access all the base game jobs and the higher level requirements for the expansion jobs. <span>There is no limit on how many jobs you can have.<span>

    <section class="main-section" id="data_centers/worlds">
      <header>Data Centers/Worlds</header>
      <p>You will be then be prompted to choose a world/data center. Refer to the official site choosing your data center and world.</p>
      <p>FFXIV is divided into Data Centers, which are groups of servers that house different Worlds (servers) where players can create characters.</p>
      <p>FFXIV has three main types of Data Centers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Physical Data Centers → Regional groupings of servers.
        <li>Logical Data Centers → Subsets of physical data centers.
        <li>Worlds (Servers) → The specific game servers where players exist.
      </ul>
      <p>Current Physical Data Centers (By Region):</p>
      <p>North America</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dynamis</li>
        <li>Aether</li>
        <li>Crystal</li>
        <li>Primal</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Europe</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chaos</li>
        <li>Light</li>
        <li>Alpha</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Japan</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gaia</li>
        <li>Mana</li>
        <li>Elemental</li>
        <li>Meteor</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Oceania</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Materia</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each Data Center contains multiple Worlds (servers), which are where players actually play the game.</p>
      <p>Example: If you're in Aether Data Center, you might be on Gilgamesh or Cactuar.</p>
      <p>Some worlds are designated as preferred (new player-friendly) or congested (overcrowded).</p>
      <p>Here is how you can do to play with others who live on different worlds/data centers.</p>
      <p>Use the World Visit System (Same Data Center)
        You can freely visit any World within your same Data Center by using Aetheryte in major cities.</p>
      <p>Data Center Travel (Between Logical DCs)
        You can temporarily travel to another Logical Data Center within the same Physical Data Center (e.g., Aether → Primal in NA).</p>
      <p>You can, if you want to, switch your character over to another world and or data center completely with the data center/world transfer service on mogstation after the fact.</p>
